# Functionality
- [ ] Add support for mongoengine.
- [ ] Enhance Mongorunway functionality to be comparable to Alembic for user convenience.
- [ ] Optimize the migration process, remove unnecessary functionality.
- [ ] Add missing tests and improve existing tests.
- [ ] Add support for Python 3.8.
- [ ] Improve logging of Mongorunway processes.

# UX
- [ ] Make the tool more user-friendly, which will also involve modifying the configuration 
(e.g., the usage of the 'init' command may not be clear to new users, including the configuration 
for validating the collection schema and its indexes).

- [ ] Improve the overall presentation of the project, including the repository and documentation, by minimizing text generated by AI.
